## Memory

Memory

1. Buffer Memory
2. Cache Memory



## Buffer Memory

Buffer memory are memory spaces that are used to store data temporarily within Dynamic Random Access Memory (RAM). CPU can store data temporarily, like the data to be forwarded to other slow speed output devices or other secondary storage devices, to enable the computer to execute other processes. It is implemented to match the speed of slow IO devices with processor.  It stores or holds the actual copy of data.   

## Cache Memory

Cache memory spaces that are used to store data temporarily within high-speed memory Dynamic Random Access Memory (RAM). Cache are accessed frequently by processes to get faster Information that is used and accessed by most of the programs.   Cache are implemented to reduce the access time and improve the latency time of the frequently used data. The cache holds the copy of original data.
